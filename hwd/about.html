          <p>
            My name is Christopher Hawkins.  I am 23 years old from Pittsburgh, PA - and have lived here my entire life.  I started off as a Multimedia major at Point Park University, which I stuck with for two and a half years.  During my third year, I decided to switch to Information Technology, where I took part in the fully online program.  I am currently in my last semester before graduation.  I hope to become a front end web developer designing websites.</p>
          </p>
          <p class="dark">
            I have been working with Information Technology and programming for about two years since I switched majors.  My main focus has been on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which is why I want to become a front end web developer.  I am hoping that I can eventually master these three languages to start putting websites together like the back of my hand.  Maybe after that I can start adding on to what I know and looking into different langauges to enhance my websites.</p>
